### Welcome To My React Portfolio

About: This is my first react portfolio which showcases some of my projects and tells the user a little bit about me. I've included a landing section with an introductory animation using package framer motion. You are then directed to the home page where you can navigate to the 'About' section, 'Projects' and 'Contact' pages. Pages all include a footer component with links to my GitHub and LinkedIn. The contact form using Email.js and is linked to my personal email address.
